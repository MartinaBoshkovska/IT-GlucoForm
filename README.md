GlucoForm is a web platform that will be used for collecting information for a novel medical research.

The members of the team behind this survey are:
* Martina Boshkovska
* Janaki Bajatovski

Project description:
The aim of this project is to create a platform that enables doctors and individual users to contribute to the creation of a dataset that has the glucose level of patients and their ECG recordings at the same time, for various times of the day. The purpose of this dataset is to be used to find correlations between ECG recordings and high glucose levels in blood and be an open contribution for the research community in the future.

The idea behind the project originated from multiple mentions of this correlation through research papers from the area of AI and Deep Learning.

Some of the features of the platform are:
* Register new users
